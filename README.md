Chatty is a project that leverages the Azure OpenAI Large Language Model (LLM) through its completion API. This project aims to provide a convenient way to summarize unread chat messages using a prompt-based approach. Additionally, it extracts action items from the input messages, offering a concise overview of important tasks.


Features
Chat Summarization: Chatty uses the powerful Azure OpenAI LLM to generate concise summaries of unread chat messages. This enables users to quickly grasp the main points of a conversation without going through the entire chat history.

Action Item Extraction: Chatty identifies and extracts action items from the input messages. Action items are tasks or responsibilities that need attention, making it easier for users to prioritize and address important matters.
